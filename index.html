      Lionel Andrés Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes
      ˈmesi] (About this soundlisten); born 24 June 1987), also known as Leo
      Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for
      Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team.
      Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one
      of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record seven Ballon
      d'Or awards,[note 2] a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was
      named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he
      had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a
      club-record 35 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey
      titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues. A prolific goalscorer and creative
      playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), a La
      Liga and European league season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and
      the UEFA Champions League (8), and most assists in La Liga (192), a La
      Liga season (21) and the Copa América (17). He also holds the record for
      most international goals by a South American male (80). Messi has scored
      over 750 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals
      by a player for a single club. Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi
      relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, for whom he made his
      competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an
      integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first
      uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first
      treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon
      d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four
      consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award
      four times and in a row.[10] During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga
      and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while
      establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two
      seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano
      Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form
      during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga
      and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was
      awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona
      in 2018, and in 2019 he won a record sixth Ballon d'Or. Out of contract,
      he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021. An Argentine
      international, Messi is both his country's highest appearance-maker and
      their all-time leading goalscorer. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA
      World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden
      Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer
      Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew
      comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his
      successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the
      youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup in 2006, and
      reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young
      player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led
      Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which
      he won the Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copa América, winning the
      Golden Ball in the 2015 edition. After announcing his international
      retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to
      qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the
      2019 Copa América, and won the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden
      Ball and Golden Boot award for the latter. This achievement would see him
      receive a record seventh Ballon d'Or in 2021. Messi has endorsed
      sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was
      the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009
      and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in
      2019. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in
      2011 and 2012. In February 2020, he was awarded the Laureus World
      Sportsman of the Year, thus becoming the first footballer and the first
      team sport athlete to win the award. Later that year, Messi became the
      second footballer (and second team-sport athlete) to surpass $1 billion in
      career earnings

      Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe,[11] the third of four
      children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia
      Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's
      side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of
      immigrants from the northcentral Adriatic Marche region of Italy and
      Catalonia, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[5]
      Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a
      passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older
      brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel
      Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[12] At the age
      of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father,
      though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal
      grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.[13] He
      was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday;
      since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking
      up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.[14][15] "When
      you saw him you would think: this kid can't play ball. He's a dwarf, he's
      too fragile, too small. But immediately you'd realise that he was born
      different, that he was a phenomenon and that he was going to be something
      impressive." – Newell's Old Boys youth coach Adrián Coria shares his first
      impression of the 12-year-old Messi.[16] A lifelong supporter of Newell's
      Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During
      the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a
      member of "The Machine of '87", the near-unbeatable youth side named for
      the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing
      ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.[17][18]
      However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, at age
      10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's
      health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which
      cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later
      reneged on their promise.[19] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River
      Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they were also
      unable to pay for his treatment due to Argentina's economic
      collapse.[20][21] His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi
      calling him "the best forward I've ever seen".[22] Messi enrolled at
      Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, at age 13. As the Messi family had
      relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in
      September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to
      sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly
      unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On
      14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their
      commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on
      a paper napkin.[20][23] In February 2001, the family relocated to
      Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium,
      Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the
      Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he
      could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without
      football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by
      nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute.
      At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to
      Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in
      Barcelona with his father.[17][23][24] After a year at Barcelona's youth
      academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish
      Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all
      competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fàbregas
      and Gerard Piqué.[25] After completing his growth hormone treatment aged
      14,[26] Messi became an integral part of the "Baby Dream Team",
      Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season
      (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A,
      who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and
      Catalan cups.[25][27] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over
      Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la máscara, the
      final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a
      league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he
      wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and
      scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution.[28] At the close
      of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a
      foreign club, but while Fàbregas and Piqué soon left for England, he chose
      to remain in Barcelona.[23][29][30] Club career Barcelona
